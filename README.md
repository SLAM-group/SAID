We create datasets for social media AI detection, and upload the train and test set for this repo. The train and test dataset are composed from detector features.

The responses pair for human identification experiment in Table 3 is given in [pairs_zhihu](https://github.com/SLAM-group/SAID/blob/main/pairs_zhihu.xlsx)
